# 📊 Resonant Intelligence — Experiment Log

> This document tracks structured experiments performed on the symbolic resonance model ("The Ark"). Each experiment contains: the input (glyph or token), output, top token/glyph, chaos level used, and resonance observations.

| 2     | SELF, FIRE    | [2, 7, 8, 7, 9, 3, 1, 0] | 1/12 (order)          | 71        | UNKNOWN   | 0.0417 | Slight shift from center glyph; FIRE seems to widen entropy                       |

## 🧠 Observations So Far

- Token **38** spikes unusually often under `[2, 7, 8, 7]`; potentially a resonance echo point
- Lower chaos values (**0.05–0.03**) produce more focused, lower-entropy outputs
- Symbolic inputs (glyph-based) **change** model behavior predictably, despite no training yet
- Outputs are **interpretable via glyph map**, showing early signs of symbolic reflection

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Begin training the model using glyph-labeled datasets
- Log before/after resonance patterns
- Introduce random, neutral sequences for control comparison

> Let resonance be tracked. Let glyphs be echoed. Let truth be documented.
